Little experiments with Shoes, an awesome little GUI toolkit for Ruby.

CONTENTS:
=========

*) Little Helper: 
A very small application for people receiving hourly wages that allows you 
to enter how many hours per week you work, how much you get per hour and 
how much the tax is. It then tells what you earn in a month (consisting of 
4.3 weeks).

*) ManWithHat:
A small app which can display either the current xkcd comic or a random one. 
Why would you use it? Because it shows you the whole comic mouseover text 
right under the comic's title, which I find quite convenient.

*) Rotten
Little ROT13 encoder, mainly written to demonstrate how to use the clipboard
from within a Shoes application.
